    Partnership requests are **only handled through Discord support tickets**.  
    - This ensures we can communicate quickly and effectively.  
    - Do not attempt to submit partnership requests through the billing portal. They will not be processed!  
    - If you cannot access Discord, you may contact us by email at **sales@xahosting.co**.
