<Danger>
    Please **do not file a payment dispute** with your bank or provider.  
    - Disputes cause major delays and almost always prevent us from issuing a refund.  
    - Customers who file disputes may also be **permanently banned from our network**.  
    - The only proper way to request a refund is through our **billing portal** or **Discord support tickets**.

## Billing Portal
    - Visit **[billing.xahosting.com](https://billing.xahosting.co/)**.
    - Log in with your **email** and **password**.
    - Click your profile picture in the top of the page & Press `Tickets`.
    - Open a new ticket requesting a refund.  
    - Our billing team will review and reply as soon as possible.

## Discord
