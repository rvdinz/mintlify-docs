A service is marked as **Suspended** when payment has not been successfully processed. Ensure your payment method is valid and all invoices are paid to restore your service.  

<Warning>In some cases, XA Hosting may also suspend services for violations of the **[Terms of Service](https://xahosting.co/terms)**.</Warning>

If your server was suspended without prior notice, reach out via our **[support tickets](https://billing.xahosting.co/tickets)** and our team will help resolve the issue.
