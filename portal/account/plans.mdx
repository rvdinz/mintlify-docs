<Info>This guide should give you a clearer picture of what plan might work best for you. If you’re still unsure, don’t worry! We’re always happy to help you pick the right option.</Info>

# Introduction
Choosing the right server plan can feel overwhelming, but we’ve broken it down into a few key points to make the decision much easier. The main things you’ll want to consider are:

- **How you plan to use the server?**
- **The number of players you expect?**
- **The amount of plugins or mods you’ll be running?**

# Server Purpose
Think about what kind of gameplay your server is meant for.

- **Casual survival with friends:** 4GB is usually fine for versions 1.8–1.12, around 6-8GB for 1.15+.
- **Competitive PvP or heavily customized setups:** You’ll want more power or even a custom plan to keep performance smooth.

# Player Count
The more players, the more RAM you’ll need. A small group won’t require much, but a large or public community server will demand significantly more resources.

Both plugins and mods increase memory usage, but mods are especially demanding.

- **Modded servers:** At least 8GB of RAM is recommended, though this varies by modpack.

- **Plugin-heavy servers:** As a rough guideline, 1GB of RAM can handle about 10 average-sized plugins. <u>Keep in mind this is only an estimate,</u> some plugins are very lightweight, while others can be resource-hungry.
