    Log in to your [**XA Hosting Game Panel**](https://panel.xahosting.co/), select your server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Database">
    Once youâ€™ve selected your server, navigate to the sidebar and click **Databases**. Then, click `Create Database` to set up a new database for your server. Make sure to give your database a name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Plugin">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Connection">
    Restart your server and check the plugin logs to ensure it successfully connects to the database. If there are connection errors, double-check the credentials and the host for your region.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Database in Your Plugin">
    Once connected, your plugin can store and retrieve data, such as player stats, inventory, or custom configurations. Verify by performing actions in-game that trigger database updates.
