## General Hosting Questions

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**  
A: We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. All payments are securely processed.

**Q: Do you provide DDoS Protection?**  
A: Absolutely. All our hosting plans include enterprise-grade DDoS protection with automated mitigation.
